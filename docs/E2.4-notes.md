# E2.4 Notes — Role-Specific Header Quick Links

## What Changed
- Added logged-in header quick links via GeneratePress hook:
  - `Search`
  - `Submit RFQ` (for users with `create_olive_rfqs`)
  - `Submit Offer` (for users with `create_olive_offers`)
  - `My Submissions` (for users with RFQ/Offer creation capability)
- Quick links resolve page URLs by slug with fallback URLs:
  - `marketplace-search`
  - `marketplace-submit`
  - `marketplace-my-submissions`
- Added CSS styles for the quick-link header bar.

## How To Test
1. Log in as `olive_buyer`:
   - Expect `Search`, `Submit RFQ`, `My Submissions`
2. Log in as supplier/professional role:
   - Expect `Search`, `Submit Offer`, `My Submissions`
3. Log in as admin:
   - Expect both `Submit RFQ` and `Submit Offer` links plus `My Submissions`
4. As guest:
   - Quick links should not render.
