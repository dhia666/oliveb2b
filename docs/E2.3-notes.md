# E2.3 Notes — My Submissions Dashboard

## What Changed
- Added frontend dashboard shortcode:
  - `[oliveb2b_my_submissions]`
- Dashboard provides for current user:
  - list of own Offers and RFQs
  - tab switching between Offers and RFQs
  - edit form for own submission
  - delete action for own submission
- Added secure handlers:
  - `oliveb2b_update_submission`
  - `oliveb2b_delete_submission`
- Added capability checks using native post caps (`edit_post`, `delete_post`) and ownership checks.
- Added nonce checks and redirect notices for success/error states.
- Seeder now creates dashboard page:
  - `/marketplace-my-submissions/`

## How To Test
1. Reseed:
   - `docker compose run --rm --user 0:0 --entrypoint wp wpcli oliveb2b seed --reset --allow-root --path=/var/www/html`
2. Open:
   - `http://localhost:8080/marketplace-my-submissions/`
3. Log in as a user that owns Offers or RFQs.
4. Confirm:
   - own submissions appear in correct tab
   - edit updates title/summary/content/taxonomies
   - delete removes own post
5. Confirm a different logged-in user cannot edit/delete submissions they do not own.
