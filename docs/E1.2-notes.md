# E1.2 Notes — Search + Filters + Results Layout

## What Changed
- Added CPTs: Suppliers, Offers, RFQs.
- Added taxonomies for filters: Country, Supplier Type, Employees.
- Added search/results UI with sidebar filters and tabbed counts (Offers vs Suppliers).
- Added dense card layout and tabs styling (europages-inspired layout concept).

## How To Test
1. Ensure plugin is active: `oliveb2b-core`.
2. Create a page and add a Shortcode block with `[oliveb2b_search_results]`.
3. Add sample Suppliers and Offers, assign Countries/Supplier Types/Employees.
4. Visit the page and confirm:
   - Left filter sidebar renders.
   - Tabs show counts for Offers/Suppliers.
   - Cards are dense and align with the concept.
5. Verify guests only see summary text for suppliers.
