# T0.3 Notes

## What Changed
- Installed and activated approved core plugins.
- Recorded plugin versions and reasons in `docs/02-tech-constraints.md`.
- Installed WP Cerber from vendor ZIP because it is closed on wordpress.org.

## How To Test
1. Run: `docker compose run --rm --user 0:0 --entrypoint wp wpcli plugin list --status=active --allow-root --path=/var/www/html`
2. Confirm active plugins: `relevanssi`, `seo-by-rank-math`, `wp-fastest-cache`, `wp-cerber`.
