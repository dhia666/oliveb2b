# E2.5 Notes — Direct Interaction Flow (No Admin Intermediation)

## What Changed
- Added direct interaction form on single listing pages for logged-in users.
- Interaction is capability-aware:
  - On `RFQ` pages: users with `create_olive_offers` can respond.
  - On `Supplier` and `Offer` pages: users with `create_olive_rfqs` or `create_olive_offers` can contact.
- Added secure handler:
  - `admin-post.php?action=oliveb2b_send_interaction`
  - Nonce + validation + permission checks.
- Delivery:
  - Sends email directly to listing owner via `wp_mail`.
  - Stores an audit record in private CPT `olive_interaction`.

## How To Test
1. Log in as supplier/professional and open an RFQ single page.
2. Submit response form and confirm success message.
3. Log in as buyer and open supplier/offer single page.
4. Submit contact form and confirm success message.
5. Confirm self-contact is blocked (no form shown on own listing).
