# E1.1 Notes — Multilingual Switcher

## What Changed
- Added OliveB2B Core plugin with a language switcher and 22 languages including Arabic RTL.
- Auto-inserts the switcher before the header via GeneratePress hook.
- Wired language URLs to Polylang when active, with fallback URLs otherwise.
- Added filters for custom language URLs and list overrides.

## How To Test
1. Ensure plugin is active: `oliveb2b-core`.
2. Load the site and confirm the language switcher appears above the header.
3. Verify Arabic is rendered RTL and each language is listed.
4. Optional: insert `[oliveb2b_language_switcher]` via a Shortcode block and confirm it renders.
